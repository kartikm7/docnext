# Quick setup
It's rather simple and straight-forward to get started!

---
- Create the Next.js project
```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/kartikm7/docnext your-project-name
```
- Change Directories
```bash
cd your-project-name
``` 
- Install dependencies
```bash 
npm i 
```
- Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

- Now the server should be running on! 
```url
http://localhost:3000
```

Voila now you can start making changes! ðŸŽ‰
