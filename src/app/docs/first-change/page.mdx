## Project Structure

Below is a visualization of our project's directory layout:
<FileTreeDemo />

<br />
> Create a new Folder **practice** inside the **docs** directory and create a **page.mdx** file 

<br />
## Making a change

Copy the markdown below and paste it in the newly created page.mdx
```markdown
# Hello World!

Write your content here. This is the content that will be displayed.
```

Once you've modified your new page, you can view it by navigating to 
```url
http://localhost:3000/docs/practice
``` 
in your web browser (assuming you're running the development server).

<Navigation previous="/docs/quick-setup" next="/docs/routing" />
