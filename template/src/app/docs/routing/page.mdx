# Routing
Routing is simplified and recursive functions are already written to auto-integrate with the in-built search function.

---

The following is the structure for routing:

```json
[
  {
    name: "Introduction",
    path: "/docs",
    children: [
      {
        name: "Quick Setup",
        path: "/docs/quick-setup"
      },
      {
        name: "Make your first change",
        path: "/docs/first-change"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    name: "Routing",
    path: "/docs/routing"
  },
  {
    name: "Deploy",
    path: "/docs/deploy",
  }
]
```
So as you add new pages, you will have to statically fill the above and it integrates with the sidebar and the search functionalilty.  
> This lies within *src/app/routes.ts*

<Navigation previous="/docs/first-change" next="/docs/deploy" />
